							<p>Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise 
							design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps 
							to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part 
							of a Latin text by the classical author and philospher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, 
							so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem 
							ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters 
							K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European 
							languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.</p>

							<p>In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be made and presented 
							with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly on the day of going live. 
							However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. 
							The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements. Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly 
							humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed 
							since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.</p>

							<p>Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32–3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the Boundaries of Goods 
							and Evils; finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, 
							consectetur, adipisci velit is the first known version ("Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief 
							and thus wants to obtain it"). It was found by Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney 
							College in Virginia; he searched for citings of consectetur" in classical Latin literature, a term of remarkably low frequency 
							in that literary corpus.</p>
